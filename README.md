## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (via LESS preprocessing)
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive grid and utilities
- JavaScript (for navigation menu toggle functionality)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of responsive design, JavaScript for interactive components, and preprocessing with LESS.

---

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Further improving my JavaScript skills for animations and dynamic content.
- Deepening my understanding of LESS and experimenting with mixins and advanced features.
- Implementing more accessibility-friendly features.

---

### Useful Resources

- [LESS Documentation](https://lesscss.org/) - Helped me understand and implement variables and nesting.
- [Bootstrap 5 Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used for layout and responsiveness.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - For CSS and JavaScript references.
